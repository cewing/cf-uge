Getting comfortable with the command line and mastering basic git versioning
workflow.

Manipulating the Filesystem
===========================

In which we learn to create, modify, move, and destroy things as well as how to
preserve a record of the actions we take.

.. slide:: Manipulating the Filesystem
    :level: 3

    Learn to make, move, and modify

.. slide:: Captured History
    :level: 3

    One way to help cement learning is to take notes

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You've already spent quite some time learning today, but have yet to take
        any notes

        Or have you?

        As it turns out, your shell keeps track of what you do as you do it

        You can look over this record using the ``history`` command

        .. container::

            Try it out:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ history

.. slide:: Reading History
    :level: 3

    You should see something like this:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ...
        432  ls
        433  ls -l
        434  cd projects/
        435  ls
        436  ls -l
        437  cd training/
        438  ls
        439  ls -l
        440  cd /
        441  cd
        442  cdcd
        443  cdcd
        444  cd /
        445  cd
        446  cd
        447  ls

.. slide:: COMMAND: ``history``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``history`` command allows you to review and revise the history of
        actions you've taken in a shell

        Providing a numeric argument will list the last *n* actions:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ history 5
            443  cdcd
            444  cd /
            445  cd
            446  cd
            447  ls

.. slide:: Paging Through History
    :level: 3

    There's probably a lot more output from that command than fits in one
    screen of your terminal

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Most of it scrolled by too fast to read

        You could read the last *n* actions

        .. container::

            Or you can review it all at your leisure by combining the ``history``
            command with another command ``less``:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ history | less

        The *pipe* character (``|``) takes the output from the first command
        and uses it as input to the second

.. slide:: Chain of Commands
    :level: 3

    Remember the Unix Philosophy::

        Do one thing and do it well
        Every output can become the input of another program

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Here, the text output by ``history`` is taken as input to the command
        ``less``

        That command allows you to control the rate of scrolling for longer files

        You can press **enter** to move one line forward at a time

        Or press **space** to move a full screen forward at once

        You can also move forward arbitrary numbers of lines, or backward!

        Try ``man less`` to learn more about this useful comand

.. slide:: COMMAND: ``less``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``less`` command allows the user to control movement through the
        reading of a file

        It provides controls for moving forward or backward through files at
        increments of an arbitrary number of lines or screens

        It does not read entire files before starting, and so is very fast

        It is particularly well suited to input *piped* from other commands
        that produce large amounts of text

.. slide:: CONCEPT: Piping
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The *pipe* (``|``) can be used to use the output of one command as the
        input to another

        This *chaining* of commands allows the savvy user to combine simple unix
        commands into complex processes with little effort and powerful results

.. slide:: Saving History
    :level: 3

    But there's more you can do with this history

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Begin by making sure that you are in your *home directory* using ``pwd``,
        ``ls`` and ``cd``

        .. container::

            Next, you'll use the *redirection* operator (``>``) to take the output from
            ``history`` and write it to a file:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ history > moving_around.txt

        You can use ``ls`` to verify that the new file "moving_around.txt" exists

        You can use the ``t`` flag to verify that it's the newest file in your home
        directory

        You can even use the ``less`` command to read it and verify that it
        contains your history.

.. slide:: CONCEPT: Redirection
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The *redirection* operator (``>``) sends the output of a command on the
        left side to a file named on the right

        If the named file does not exist, it is created

        If it does exist, it is overwritten

        If the operator is doubled (``>>``) then output is *added* to an existing
        file instead of replacing it

        You can do a *lot* more with redirection (try googling for *bash
        redirection*) but thats enough for today

.. slide:: Take Notes
    :level: 3

    Now that you have this file with your command history, open it in your
    editor:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ subl moving_around.txt

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Take the next 10 minutes or so to edit that history

        Add notes to lines after the commands you found particularly interesting or
        surprising

        Add information explaining the purpose of a command, and the result

        You can delete boring lines or even your embarassing mistakes

        Take this opportunity to ask your instructors questions, if you haven't
        already

        Make sure you understand everything you've done so far today

.. slide:: Keep It Safe
    :level: 3

    Come to think of it, it might be nice to keep these notes (and more you'll
    make today) safe

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Let's begin by making a place to keep them

        .. container::

            Use the ``mkdir`` command to create a new directory here in your *home
            directory* to hold these notes:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ mkdir uge_workshop

        Use ``ls`` to confirm that the new directory exists

        Use the ``l`` flag with ls to confirm that the new directory is a directory

.. slide:: Put Things in Their Place
    :level: 3

    Now that you have a directory to hold your notes, move them on in

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You can use the ``mv`` command to move a file from one place to another

        This command is a bit different from others we've seen in that it requires
        *two* paths

        The first is the address of the thing you want to move

        The second is the address of where you want to put it

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ mv moving_around.txt ./uge_workshop/

.. slide:: Better Names
    :level: 3

    Actually, the filename "moving_around.txt" is not all that great

    We should rename it to something better, like "unix_notes.txt"

    .. container::

        You can use the ``mv`` command to do this, too:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ mv ./uge_workshop/moving_around.txt ./uge_workshop/unix_notes.txt

    That's better

    Don't forget to add any notes you might want about ``mv`` to your newly
    renamed file

.. slide:: COMMAND: ``mv``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``mv`` command allows *moving* files from place to place in a
        filesystem

        The command expects two paths: a thing to be moved and a place to move
        it

        The command can be used to move files and also to rename them

        *Flags* allow you to handle conditions like there being a file of the
        same name already in the destination in various ways

        Try ``man mv`` to learn more about this command

.. slide:: Saving Your Work
    :level: 3

    You've got all these great notes

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        It'd be terrible if something were to happen to them

        This is where having something like version control can come in handy

        It can allow you to keep a history of your work on a project like this
        safe

        And can also allow you to collaborate with others over time

        We'll start by creating a *repository* for our work from today

        We'll be using the ``git`` Distributed Version Control System

.. slide:: Install Git
    :level: 3

    .. container::

        If you haven't already done so, please download and install git now

            http://git-scm.com/downloads

    .. container::

        Windows users, please install git from here instead:

            http://msysgit.github.io/

.. slide:: Basic Configuration
    :level: 3

    You should also be sure to set up the basic configuration git requires

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        In order to make commits, git wants to know your name and email address

        .. container::

            We use the ``config`` git command to set these up:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git config --global user.name "Cris Ewing"
                $ git config --global user.email "cris@crisewing.com"

        Using this information, each time you make a *commit* git will record
        that *you* made the changes, and will provide contact information for
        any who wish to consult with you.

.. slide:: GIT COMMAND: ``config``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``config`` command sets configuration values either globally or for
        a single repository.

        You can use it to let git know who you are and control the way git
        works for you.

        You can read more about this powerful command in the
        `Git Configuration`_ chapter of `the Pro Git book`_.

.. _Git Configuration: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration
.. _the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2


.. slide:: Your First Repository
    :level: 3

    Once git is installed and configured, creating your first repository is a
    snap

    Begin by changing directories into the one that holds the files you want to
    save

    In your case, that's the new ``uge_workshop`` directory you just created a
    moment ago

    Once there, use the ``init`` git command to create a new repository

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git init
        Initialized empty Git repository in /home/cewing/uge_workshop/.git

.. slide:: GIT COMMAND: ``init``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``init`` command creates a brand new repository in your current
        working directory. (remember `pwd`?)

        You only need to **run this command once** for any project you start.

        You **do not** run this command for projects you *clone* from other
        sources like GitHub.

        Read more about how to start a repository in the chapter
        `Getting a Git Repository`_ in `the Pro Git book`_.

.. _Getting a Git Repository: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository


.. slide:: What's Up, Git?
    :level: 3

    You can now check the status of your repository using ``status``:

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git status
            On branch master

            Initial commit

            Untracked files:
              (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

                unix_notes.txt

            nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

        Notice that git is quite verbose in telling you what's going on

        You can see that you have one untracked file

        Git even tells you what to do next

.. slide:: GIT COMMAND: ``status``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``status`` command will provide information about the current state
        of your repository.

        You use it to see which files need to be added and which have been
        changed and are awaiting commits.

        You should make a habit of frequently checking the status of your
        repository to develop a good awareness of how things are changing.

        Read more about this command in `Recording Changes to the Repository`_
        in `the Pro Git book`_.

.. _Recording Changes to the Repository: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_checking_status


.. slide:: Adding your first file
    :level: 3

    A repository is simply a collection of things you care about

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        In order for git to save anything, it must first be ``added`` to the
        repository

        .. container::

            Use the ``add`` command to add your ``unix_notes.txt`` file:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git add unix_notes.txt

        There should be no output here, but your file has now been added

.. slide:: GIT COMMAND: ``add``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``add`` command places a new file under the control of your
        repository.

        Once a file has been added, git is aware of the file and will track
        changes to it.

        The command also adds files that have been modified from their known
        state to the *stage*.

        Read more about ``add`` in `Recording Changes to the Repository`_
        in `the Pro Git book`_.

.. slide:: QUESTION
    :level: 2

    How can you tell that the file has been added to the repository?

.. slide:: Always Check Status
    :level: 3

    Of course, you use ``status``

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        It's a good idea to develop the habit of checking the status of your
        repository regularly

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git status
            On branch master

            Initial commit

            Changes to be committed:
              (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

                new file:   unix_notes.txt

        You can now see that the notes file has been added and is ready to be
        *committed*

.. slide:: Git is Helpful
    :level: 3

    Pay attention to one specific part of the output of your ``status``
    command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        Changes to be committed:
          (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

    This is one example of how git tries to be helpful to users.

    It is telling you that you can *undo* what you've just done.

    Learning to read these helpful messages will help you level up in your git
    skills.

.. slide:: Commits Save Changes
    :level: 3

    Until you *commit* your chages nothing is permanent

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        As the previous slide showed, we could still *unstage* these changes,
        allowing our repository to forget this file exists

        But we don't want to do that

        .. container::

            So let's go ahead and use ``commit`` to save what we've done:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git commit -m "adding unix notes, first draft"
                [master (root-commit) 0bc447c] adding unix notes, first draft
                 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
                 create mode 100644 unix_notes.txt

        .. container::

            And ``status`` shows the result:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git status
                On branch master
                nothing to commit, working directory clean

.. slide:: Being Informative
    :level: 3

    Keeping a history of your work is good.

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Providing descriptions of the changes you make is even better.

        In your first commit above, you *modified* the git ``commit`` command
        with a *flag*: ``-m``

        This flag takes a single argument, a *message* about the commit you are
        making.

        If you don't provide this *flag*, git will open a text editor so that
        you can provide this *message*.

.. slide:: GIT COMMAND: ``commit``
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``commit`` command is used to create a permanent record of changes
        to your repository.

        It saves all the changes that have been *staged*.

        Each commit saves:

        * The changes made to each file on the *stage*
        * The identity of the person who made the changes
        * The date and time the change was made
        * A brief message about the nature of the changes made
        * A universally unique identifier for the set of changes

        Read more about this command in `Recording Changes to the Repository`_
        in `the Pro Git book`_.

.. slide:: What Makes a Repository?
    :level: 3

    You have now created a repository and added a new file to it

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You can even look at the history of your repository now (short though it
        may be)

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git log
            commit 0bc447c0cfd0b7856cd19c705e8eefa0c64283de
            Author: cewing <cris@crisewing.com>
            Date:   Sat Nov 15 03:33:09 2014 -0800

                adding unix notes, first draft

        But how does this all happen?

        Where is the stuff that makes this work?


.. slide:: Peek Behind the Curtain
    :level: 3

    If you use the ``ls`` command inside your repository, all you'll see is
    your notes file

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        But there's more there than meets the eye

        .. container::

            Use the `a` flag to ``ls`` to see *all* items in the folder:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ ls -la
                total 0
                drwxr-xr-x   4 cewing  staff  136 Nov 15 03:15 .
                drwxr-xr-x   6 cewing  staff  204 Nov 15 03:15 ..
                drwxr-xr-x  13 cewing  staff  442 Nov 15 03:33 .git
                -rw-r--r--   1 cewing  staff    0 Nov 15 03:15 unix_notes.txt

        That ``.git`` directory is the special secret sauce

        Everything that git knows about your repository is held in that folder

        If you delete it (don't), your repository becomes just another
        directory

.. slide:: CONCEPT: Hidden Files
    :level: 2

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        This ``.git`` directory is an example of a *hidden file*

        In Unix, any file whose name begins with ``.`` is, by default, not
        shown to the user unless specifically asked for

        This helps to keep the clutter associated with maintenance and
        configuration out of sight

        The ``.`` and ``..`` items in every directory on the filesystem are
        also examples of this type of file

        You know what they do, right?

        Add a note to your ``unix_notes.txt`` about *hidden files*

.. slide:: Tracking Changes
    :level: 3

    Now that your notes file has changed, you'll want to preserve that change

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        .. container::

            Start by viewing the ``status`` of your repository:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git status
                On branch master
                Changes not staged for commit:
                  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
                  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

                    modified:   unix_notes.txt

                no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

        Notice that you have *two* choices, to ``add`` the file or to *discard* the
        changes

        Also notice that git offers you a choice to use ``git commit -a``

        **Do Not Do That**

.. slide:: Stage Your Changes
    :level: 3

    You have a file that has been changed, you must ``add`` the file to the
    stage so it can be committed

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git add unix_notes.txt
            $ git status

    And that's the basics of git workflow

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You ``init`` a repository **once**

        Then you ``add`` a file or files to it and you ``commit`` those changes

        Then you modify the files, ``add`` them to the stage and ``commit`` the
        changes

        Lather, rinse and repeat

    .. rst-class:: left
    .. container::

        The ``log`` command shows a view of the history of your repository

        That history can be displayed in a wide variety of ways

        Learning how to use the ``log`` command will help to make you a git
        power user.

        You can read more about this command in `Viewing the Command History`_
        in `the Pro Git book`_.

    In which we learn a bit about what's going on here

.. slide:: What is git?
    :level: 3

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        A "version control system"

        A history of everything you do to your files

        A graph of "states" in which your files has existed

        That last one is a bit tricky, so let's talk it over for a minute

.. slide:: Our History, So Far
    :level: 3

    We began by creating a brand new, empty repository with ``git init``:

    .. figure:: /_static/git_repo_initialized.png
        :width: 15%
        :class: centered build

.. slide:: Our History, So Far
    :level: 3

    We added a new file to the repository and committed that change with ``git
    commit``:

    .. figure:: /_static/git_first_commit.png
        :width: 70%
        :class: centered build

.. slide:: Our History, So Far
    :level: 3

    Then, we updated that file, added the modifications to the stage, and
    committed again:

        :width: 70%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        A git repository is a set of points in time, with history showing where
        you've been.

        Each point has a *name* (here *A*, *B*, *C*) that uniquely identifies it,
        called a *hash*

        The path from one point to the previous is represented by the *difference*
        between the two points.

.. slide:: A Picture of git
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_head.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Each point in time can also have a label that points to it.

        One of these is *HEAD*, which always points to the place in the timeline
        that you are currently looking at.

.. slide:: A Picture of git
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_master_branch.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You may also be familiar with the label "master".

        This is the name that git automatically gives to the first *branch* in a
        repository.

        A *branch* is actually just a label that points to a specific point in
        time.

.. slide:: A Picture of git
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_new_commit.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        When you make a *commit* in git, you add a new point to the timeline.

        The HEAD label moves to this new point.

        So does the label for the *branch* you are on.

.. slide:: Making a Branch
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_new_branch.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You can make a new *branch* with the ``branch`` command.

        This adds a new label to the current commit.

        Notice that it *does not* check out that branch.

.. slide:: Try It Out
    :level: 3

    Go ahead and try this out yourself

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Use the ``branch`` command to create a new *branch* for your repo called
        *git-notes*:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git branch git-notes

        You can see the new branch by using the ``branch`` command without a name:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git branch
              git-notes
            * master

        Notice that git tells you which branch you are on with an asterisk (``*`` )

.. slide:: Switching Branches
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_checkout_branch.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You can use the ``checkout`` command to switch to the new branch.

        This associates the HEAD label with the *session01* label.

.. slide:: Try It Out
    :level: 3

    Go ahead and try checking out your own new branch with ``checkout``

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        As you do so, visualize the changes that are happening

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git checkout git-notes

        .. container::

            Use ``git branch`` to see which branch is *active*:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git branch
                * git-notes
                  master

.. slide:: Making a change
    :level: 3

    Now that you have the ``git-notes`` branch checked out, make some changes

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        First, add a new file to your repository called ``git_notes.txt``

        .. container::

            To do so, use the unix ``touch`` command:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ touch git_notes.txt

        .. container::

            Then, open the new file in your editor:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ subl git_notes.txt

        Take the next ten minutes to write down your notes on what you've
        learned about git so far

.. slide:: Saving Your Changes
    :level: 3

    Once you've finished your notes, don't forget to use your simple git
    workflow to save them

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Do you remember the workflow?

        ``git status``

        ``git add git_notes.txt``

        ``git commit -m "starting notes on git"``

        Again, try to *visualize* what's happening here

.. slide:: Visualizing the Results
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/git_commit_on_branch.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        While it is checked out, new commits move the label for the new branch.

        Notice that HEAD is *always* the same as "where you are now"

.. slide:: Isolating Your Changes

    You can use this to switch between branches and make changes in isolation.

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        .. figure:: /_static/git_checkout_master.png
            :width: 65%
            :class: centered

        .. figure:: /_static/git_new_commit_on_master.png
            :width: 65%
            :class: centered

.. slide:: Working with Remotes
    :level: 3

    Since ``git`` is a *distributed* versioning system, there is no **central**
    repository that serves as the one to rule them all.

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Instead, you work with *local* repositories, and *remotes* that they are
        connected to.

        In the workshop today, you've created a brand new repository

        It is not connected to *any* remote

        .. container::

            You can verify this with the ``remote`` git command and the ``v``
            flag:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git remote -v

.. slide:: Enter GitHub
    :level: 3

    Remotes serve as a way of sharing work with other developers

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        GitHub has emerged as a premier location for such sharing

        It provides you with a common location that anyone can access

        In addition, it provides a number of useful tools for managing work
        that is being shared among a dispersed group of people

        But to use it, you must first attach a new, empty repository in GitHub
        to your local repository as a *remote*

        Begin by opening your browser and going to your personal account on GitHub

.. slide:: Creating a Repository in GitHub
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/github_create_repo_menu.png
        :width: 60%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        At the top right side of the window, look for your name and avatar

        Next to it you'll find a small ``+`` sign, click that

        From the menu that opens, select **New repository**

.. slide:: Set Up Your Repository
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/github_setup_repository.png
        :width: 75%
        :class: centered

    Set up your repository as shown here, then click **Create Repository**

.. slide:: Add Your Remote
    :level: 3

    In your browser, you should be viewing your newly created repository

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You should see instructions about what to do next.

        In your terminal, use your unix knowledge to ensure you are in your local
        ``uge_workshop`` directory

        .. container::

            Then, add a remote to your local repository using the ``remote`` git command

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git remote add origin https://github.com/cewing/uge-workshop.git

        .. container::

            Verify that this worked using the ``remote`` command with the ``v`` flag:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git remote -v
                origin  https://github.com/cewing/uge-workshop.git (fetch)
                origin  https://github.com/cewing/uge-workshop.git (push)

.. slide:: Push to Your Remote
    :level: 3

    Before pushing, verify that your local repository has the ``master`` branch
    checked out

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Remember how to switch branches?

        ``git checkout master``

        Then, push your master branch to github:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git push -u origin master
            Counting objects: 6, done.
            ...
            To git@github.com:cewing/uge-workshop.git
             * [new branch]      master -> master
            Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

.. slide:: Solidify Your Learning
    :level: 3

    Switch back to your git-notes branch

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Once there, spend five to ten minutes jotting down your notes on git
        remotes

        This is an excellent time to ask any questions you might have

        After you're done, save your changes in git

        Finally, push your git-notes branch up to github too

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ git push -u origin git-notes
            ...
            To git@github.com:cewing/uge-workshop.git
             * [new branch]      git-notes -> git-notes
            Branch git-notes set up to track remote branch git-notes from origin.

.. slide:: More Git Workflow
    :level: 3

    What we've just done is very common workflow

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Imagine your repository is not notes from a class, but code for a vital
        website

        Further imagine that your production server is running using code on
        the master branch

        You wouldn't want anyone making willy-nilly changes to master

        It would be much better to have only tested, vetted code end up in
        master

        So, you ask your development team to implement fixes and features on
        branches

        What comes next?

.. slide:: The Mighty Pull Request
    :level: 3

    The next step is for your developers to make **Pull Requests** when they
    have completed their work

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        A **pull request** lets the manager of the project know that work is
        ready to be reviewed

        The UI in GitHub provides ways to comment on code

        Developers can make changes in response to comments and get them
        reviewed as well

        All this is done, again, in the web browser

        Go back to GitHub, to your new ``uge-workshop`` repository

.. slide:: Creating a PR
    :level: 3

    On the homepage of your repository, find the **Pull Requests** button in
    the menu on the right

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        Click it

        It will open a page listing open pull requests

        There should be none

        .. container::

            click the big, green button that says **New pull request**

            .. figure:: /_static/github_new_pr_button.png

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        When you first arrive, you'll be offered a chance to set the to and
        from points for your new **PR**

        Set them as shown in the image here

        The ``base`` should be your master branch and the ``compare`` will be
        the git-notes branch

.. slide:: Finishing Up
    :level: 3

    When you're set, click **Create pull request**

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        On the next screen, enter a note about why the PR should be merged

        Then click **Create pull request** again

        And now, your developer is done

        It's time for the manager to review

.. slide:: Reviewing a PR
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/github_pr_review_tabs.png
        :width: 65%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        In reviewing a pull request, the owner of a project is given quite a
        few tools

        This tab bar shows that you can view individual files, all changed
        files, or only the review commments made so far

        If you click on the code tabs, you can see the differences between the
        files in the ``from`` side and those in the ``to`` side

        And if you hover over a line, an icon offers a chance to add comments
        directly alongside the code

        So long as the request is open, changes made to the branch will be
        included

.. slide:: Merging the PR
    :level: 3

    .. figure:: /_static/github_merge_pr.png
        :width: 70%
        :class: centered

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        When work is completed to everyone's satisfaction, the **PR** can be
        merged

        The manager can click on the **Conversation** tab and look for this
        green button

        It indicates that the pull request can be merged without conflict

        If not present, work will be required to resolve conflicts before a
        merge can be completed.

.. slide:: Merge Your PR
    :level: 3

    Assuming you've been following along, you should be ready to merge your own
    pull request

    Go ahead and do so when you're ready

    When it's done, you've learned the basics of professional git workflow

.. slide:: Pulling Changes
    :level: 3

    Now that you've merged git-notes to master on GitHub, your local master
    branch is out-of-date

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        To catch up, we have to pull the changes back

        Return to your terminal, and checkout the master branch of your
        repository

        Make sure to use ``git branch`` to verify that you have master checked
        out

        .. container::

            When ready, type the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ git pull origin master

.. slide:: What happened
    :level: 3

    When you executed that command a few things took place:

    .. rst-class:: build

    * Git ``fetched`` all of the changes on master to a local branch called
      origin/master
    * Git ``merged`` the changes from origin/master to your local master branch

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        You can accomplish the same thing on your own as two commands

        But doing just one is so much easier

.. slide:: Review
    :level: 1

    Take a moment to reflect

.. slide:: COMMANDS

    We've added the following unix commands to our repertoire:

    =========== ==============================================================
    command     purpose
    =========== ==============================================================
    ``history`` Interact with your command line history
    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------
    ``less``    Read large text inputs in a controlled fashion
    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------
    ``mv``      Move files from one place to another, or rename them, or both
    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------
    ``touch``   Create a new file, or update the modified date for an existing

    ``rm``      Remove a file from the filesystem entirely
    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------
    ``rmdir``   Remove a directory from the filesystem if it is empty
    =========== ==============================================================

.. slide:: Git Commands
    :level: 3

    We've also learned quite a few git commands

    ``git init``
      Creates a new repository in the *present working directory*

    ``git status``
      Shows the state of the repository and all files in the same directory,
      including ones not yet added

    ``git add <file>``
      Adds a new file to the repository, or adds a modified file to the stage
      so they can be committed

    ``git commit``
      Commits all staged changes to files in the repository for safe keeping

    ``git push``
      Pushes all changes from your local repository to the named remote

.. slide:: More Git Commands
    :level: 3

    ``git branch``
      Create and manage new and existing branches in your repository

    ``git checkout``
      Change the active branch and/or the location of HEAD``

    ``git pull``
      Fetch and merge all changes from a remote repository branch to a local
      branch

    ``git log``
      Shows a list of the commits in the repository along with information
      about the time, owner and message associated with the change

    ``git config``
      Set configuration for how git operates, either globally or per repository

.. slide:: Wrapping Up
    :level: 3

    There's much much more that could be said

    .. rst-class:: build
    .. container::

        But that's all I've written up here

        If there's some spare time, we'd be happy to continue going over more
        advanced Unix commands or git operations

        However, what you've learned today is plenty and enough to serve you
        well for quite some time

        Master these fundamentals and you'll be well on your way to guru-hood
